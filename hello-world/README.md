# hello world

## Introduction

A few derivative examples from the starter [code](https://github.com/CamJam-EduKit/EduKit3/tree/master/CamJam%20Edukit%203%20-%20GPIO%20Zero/Code) provided with the kit.

## Set up

The robot consists of the following linked as per [instructions](https://github.com/CamJam-EduKit/EduKit3/blob/master/CamJam%20Edukit%203%20-%20GPIO%20Zero/CamJam%20EduKit%203%20-%20Robotics%20Worksheet%202%20(GPIO%20Zero)%20-%20Building%20a%20Robot.pdf) that came with the kit 

This will have a robot with two wheels and a small metal ball bearing in the front.

> [!TIP]
> If you're using a battery bank, place it near to the wheels otherwise you may find the load is to heavy for the robot to move around easily.

# Scripts

The script names are self-explanatory.

> [!INFO] 
> You need to ssh into the raspberry pi with the driver hat to run these scripts.
